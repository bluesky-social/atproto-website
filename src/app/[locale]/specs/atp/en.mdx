# AT Protocol

The Authenticated Transfer Protocol ("AT Protocol" or "atproto") is a network protocol for building open social web applications. {{ className: 'lead' }}

Some of the main protocol features and design themes include: {{ className: 'lead' }}

- Self-authenticating data and identity, allowing seamless account migrations and redistribution of content {{ className: 'lead' }}
- Design for "big world" use cases, scaling to billions of accounts {{ className: 'lead' }}
- Delegated authority over application-layer schemas and aggregation infrastructure {{ className: 'lead' }}
- Re-use of content-addressed data models from prior P2P protocols, and networking primitives from the web platform {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Protocol Structure

**Identity:** account control is rooted in persistent [DID](/specs/did) identifiers (like `did:plc:ewvi7nxzyoun6zhxrhs64oiz`). These can be universally resolved to determine the current service provider location and [cryptographic keys](/specs/cryptography) associated with the account. [Handles](/specs/handle) complement DIDs and provide mutable and human-meaninful usernames in the form of DNS hostnames (eg, `user.example.com`).

**Data:** public content is stored in content-addressed and cryptographically verifiable [repositories](/specs/repository). Data records and network messages all conform to a unified [data model](/specs/data-model) with both [CBOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBOR) and JSON representations. [Labels](/specs/label) are a separate form of lightweight metadata, individually signed and distributed outside repositories, which can be used for moderation and badging.

**Network:** client-server and server-server HTTP APIs are described with lexicon schemas ([XRPC](/specs/xrpc)), as are WebSocket [event streams](/specs/event-stream). Individual records can be globally referenced with [AT-URIs](/specs/at-uri-scheme). [Personal Data Servers (PDS)](/specs/account) host accounts, handle key management, manage repositories, provide authentication, and proxy client HTTP requests. Relays aggregate from many PDS hosts and output a unified full-network [firehose](/specs/sync).

**Application:** APIs and record schemas for applications built on atproto are specified in [Lexicons](/specs/lexicon), which are referenced by [Namespaced Identifiers (NSIDs)](/specs/nsid). Application-specific aggregations (like search) are provided by Application View (App View) services. Clients can include mobile apps, desktop software, or web interfaces. Clients are authorized using [OAuth](/specs/oauth), and [permissions](/specs/permission) are used to grant access to users' protocol resources.

AT Protocol itself does not specify how common social web conventions like follows or avatars should work, and instead leaves them to application designers. Applications interoperate by reading and writing user data records following published Lexicon schemas.

The `com.atproto.*` Lexicons provide common APIs for things like account management and record creation. These could be considered part of AT Protocol itself, though they may also be extended or replaced over time as needed.


## Protocol Extension and Applications

AT Protocol was designed to provide stability and interoperation within mature network ecosystems, while at the same time allowing product designers to rapidly ship differentiating features and novel application experiences.

The core application development and extension mechanism is to design and publish new Lexicon schemas under independent NSID hierarchies. Lexicon schemas can define new data record schemas, new HTTP API endpoints, and new event stream message types. New applications often require new network aggregation services ("AppViews") and client app support (eg, mobile apps or web interfaces).

It is expected that competing developers will reuse Lexicon schemas and public data records across organizational boundaries. For example, applications developers can reuse and contribute to the existing public social graph data described by the `app.bsky.*` Lexicon schemas. They can extend with new data types by publishing Lexicon schemas under their own namespace. That data becomes part of the common pool of public data that any other developer can integrate and build with.

Governance structures for individual Lexicon namespaces are flexible. They could be developed and maintained by volunteer communities, corporations, consortia, academic researchers, funded non-profits, etc.


## What is Missing?

**Non-Public Data:** mechanisms for personal and group data sharing are planned, and should support a wide variety of application functionality. These will be large additions to the protocol framework. We recommend against simply "bolting on" encryption or private content using the existing protocol primitives.

**Protocol Governance and Formal Standards Process:** once the basic protocol framework has been shown to work between multiple interoperating organizations, the plan is to bring the protocol specifications to an existing standards body (like the IETF) for revision and independent review.

Possible future changes and extensions to the protocol are described in the individual specification documents.
