# Labeler Subscrptions

Labeler services each have a service identity, meaning a DID document. This is the DID that appears in the label source (**`src`**) field.

To include labels from a given labeler, set the `atproto-accept-labelers` header on an XRPC request to a comma-separated list of the DIDs of the labelers you want to include, like so:

```bash
curl -H "atproto-accept-labelers: did:plc:vmt7o7y6titkqzzxav247zrn, did:plc:vmt7o7y6titkqzzxav247zrn"
```

## Use labels in your app

Labels may be placed on accounts or records. Apps can interprets targets in different ways:

- On an account: has account-wide effects
- On a profile: affects only the profile record (e.g. user avatar) and never hides any content, including the account in listings.
- On content: affects the content specifically (a post record, a list, a feed, etc.)

### Reporting

To send a report to a Labeler, use the `com.atproto.moderation.createReport` procedure. Users may send reports to any of their labelers.

To specify which labeler should receive the label, set the `atproto-proxy` header with the DID of the labeler and the service key of `atproto_labeler`. In the official TypeScript SDK, it looks like this:

```typescript
agent
  .withProxy('atproto_labeler', 'did:web:my-labeler.com')
  .createModerationReport({
    reasonType: 'com.atproto.moderation.defs#reasonViolation',
    reason: 'They were being such a jerk to me!',
    subject: { did: 'did:web:bob.com' },
  })
```
