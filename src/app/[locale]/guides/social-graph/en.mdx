## Querying social graphs

AT Protocol records are public...

See <a href="https://davidgasquez.com/exploring-atproto-python/">Exploring AT Protocol with Python</a> for another example of this approach.

## Backlinks

One of the most powerful ways to get social graph data from AT Protocol is through the use of **backlinks**. Querying backlinks lets you resolve all of the records linking *to* any given record, *or* identity.

Because all AT Protocol records are openly available and addressible via an `at://` URI, this makes it possible to encode nested API queries into individual URLs. The community project <a href="https://pdsls.dev/at://did:plc:vmt7o7y6titkqzzxav247zrn/app.bsky.feed.post/3mbaxebcd6s2f" target="_blank">pds.ls</a> does this, for example.
