## Using lex

Lexicon schemas enable code generation with types and validation. Our SDKs each install a `lex` tool that lets you generate a type-safe client that knows which parameters each AT endpoint expects.

## TypeScript

First, install the `@atproto/lex` package:

```bash
npm install -g @atproto/lex
```

This provides the `lex` command, which you can use to install Lexicons into a local project:

```bash
lex install app.bsky.feed.post app.bsky.feed.like
```

This creates:

- `lexicons.json` - manifest tracking installed Lexicons and their versions (CIDs)
- `lexicons/` - directory containing the Lexicon JSON files

Finally, generate TypeScript schemas from the installed Lexicons:

```bash
lex build
```

This generates TypeScript files in `./src/lexicons`. Now, you'll have these functions available to use in your code:

```tsx
import { Client } from '@atproto/lex'
import * as app from './lexicons/app.js'

// Create an unauthenticated client instance
const client = new Client('https://public.api.bsky.app')

// Start making requests using generated schemas
const response = await client.call(app.bsky.actor.getProfile, {
  actor: 'pfrazee.com',
})
```

For more guidance on working with `lex`, refer to the [readme](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto-internal/blob/msi/lex/packages/lex/lex/README.md#json-schemas).
