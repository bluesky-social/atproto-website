}

Most parts of the Atmosphere stack have supported deployments. Some components are easier to self-host than others, depending on whether you are providing application-level infrastructure (like an AppView or Relay) or data-level infrastructure (like a PDS).

## PDS

Resources for self-hosting a PDS, including install steps, Docker images and Frequently Asked Questions, are available from the [PDS](https://github.com/bluesky-social/pds) Github repo. Start here if you want to host your own PDS!

The PDS Docker image includes [goat](https://github.com/bluesky-social/goat), our command line tool for performing admin functions.

If you are moving your account from one PDS (such as a Bluesky-hosted PDS) to another, refer to [Account Migration](/guides/account-migration).

If you need to change the *domain name* of a self-hosted PDS, you need to:

- Change the PLC entries for *each* of your hosted accounts. You can use community-maintained interfaces like [boat](https://boat.kelinci.net/plc-applicator) for this.
- Update your DNS configuration as you would for any other server, then change the domain name in `pds.env`.

For guidance on scaling and hardening a PDS, refer to [Going to Production](/guides/going-to-production).

Bluesky runs many PDSs with an “entryway” in front of them. For information on this implementation, refer to [Entryway](https://docs.bsky.app/docs/advanced-guides/entryway).

There are also several community PDS implementations! For example:
- [Tranquil PDS](https://tangled.org/lewis.moe/bspds-sandbox), written in Rust.
- [Cocoon](https://tangled.org/hailey.at/cocoon), written in Go.

## Tap

Tap is used for syncing existing records from the AT network and then continuing to receive new records from the firehose. For a guide to deploying Tap, refer to the [Tap readme](https://github.com/bluesky-social/indigo/blob/main/cmd/tap/README.md#distribution--deployment).

We also provide a quick start guide for [deploying Tap](https://github.com/bluesky-social/indigo/blob/main/cmd/tap/RAILWAY_DEPLOY.md) to [Railway](https://railway.com/).

## AppViews or Relays

Hosting your own AppView or Relay is possible, but resource intensive. Compared with hosting your own PDS, which is a way of personally controlling access to your own data repository, hosting an AppView or Relay is something that you would only do to provide application-level infrastructure. Generally, the first thing you would need to do here is replicate all of the data in the network for the Lexicons that your application handles. Refer to the [Sync](/guides/sync) docs for a starting point.

There are lots of other decisions that will go into designing and running your own Atmosphere apps! This will not be a comprehensive list of recommendations.

- For your app's signup flow, you will need users to log in or create an account. We generally recommend hosting your own PDS alongside your app to allow first-time users of the Atmosphere — who may not yet be aware of the concept of a PDS — to sign up directly within your application. Your PDS and AppView should have [different domain names](/going-to-production#domain-names).

## Ozone and Osprey

Refer to the [Osprey Github repo](https://github.com/roostorg/osprey) and [Using Ozone](/guides/using-ozone) for self-hosting guidance.

## Deploy Recipes

For community-contributed deployment solutions that do not use our official tooling, and may support different environments, refer to the [deploy-recipes](https://github.com/bluesky-social/deploy-recipes) Github repo. Contributions are welcome!
