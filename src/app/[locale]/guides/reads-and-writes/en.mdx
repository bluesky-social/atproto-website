## AT Records

The AT Protocol distributes user data across different nodes of your network, using the core building blocks of the web. The AT Protocol interconnects applications so that their backends share state, including user accounts and content, in individual data repositories. Many operations you'll perform when working with AT apps involve reading and writing these data repositories.

For more context, see [ATProto for distributed systems engineers](/articles/atproto-for-distsys-engineers) and [The ATProto Ethos](/articles/atproto-ethos).

## Prerequisites

Reading and writing AT data repositories requires an authenticated client. You can authenticate with [password authentication](/guides/sdk-auth) or [OAuth](/guides/oauth-patterns). The other guides in this section assume you have already set up an authenticated client.

You may also want to familiarize yourself with [data repositories](/guides/sync#data-repositories) and [Lexicons](/guides/lexicon).
