## AT Records

The AT Protocol distributes user data across different nodes of your network, using the core building blocks of the web. The AT Protocol interconnects applications so that their backends share state, including user accounts and content, in individual data repositories. Many operations you'll perform when working with AT apps involve reading and writing these data repositories.

For more context, see [ATProto for distributed systems engineers](/articles/atproto-for-distsys-engineers) and [The ATProto Ethos](/articles/atproto-ethos).

## Prerequisites

Reading and writing AT data repositories requires an authenticated client. You can authenticate with [password authentication](/guides/sdk-auth) or [OAuth](/guides/oauth-patterns). The guides in this section assume you have already set up an authenticated client.

## API Methods

After [authenticating](/guides/reads-and-writes#creating-a-client), you'll be able to make other API requests.

To make API requests, you'll need to specify a particular [Lexicon](/guides/lexicon). For example, Bluesky posts are available under the `app.bsky.feed.post` Lexicon.

### TypeScript

Use `lex` to install the `app.bsky.feed.post` and `app.bsky.actor.profile` Lexicons as described in [Installing Lexicons](/guides/installing-lexicons):

```bash
npm install -g @atproto/lex
lex install app.bsky.feed.post app.bsky.actor.profile
lex build
```

This will generate TypeScript types for the Lexicons in your project. You can use this `import` statement to access all installed Lexicons:

```tsx
import * as app from './lexicons/app.js'
```

This will give you access to the API methods for your Lexicons. Now you are ready to start [making requests](/guides/reading-data)!
