# Reads and Writes

In this guide, you'll read and write from an Atmosphere data repository.

The AT Protocol distributes user data across different nodes of your network, using the core building blocks of the web. The AT Protocol interconnects applications so that their backends share state, including user accounts and content, in individual data repositories. Many operations you'll perform when working with AT apps involve reading and writing these data repositories.

For more context, see [ATProto for distributed systems engineers](/articles/atproto-for-distsys-engineers) and [The ATProto Ethos](/articles/atproto-ethos).

## Prerequisites

To follow this guide, create a new TypeScript project, then install the AT SDK:

### Typescript

```bash
npm install @atproto/lex @atproto/api
```

### Go

TK, should use code tab elements

Because AT uses regular HTTP verbs and HTTP endpoints, you can also follow this guide by using a CLI tool like cURL to make HTTP requests following the [HTTP Reference](https://docs.bsky.app/docs/category/http-reference) endpoints. Most users will want to use an SDK.

## Creating a Client

The first step when working with AT data is authenticating. You can authenticate using any [OAuth](/guides/auth) provider, or with `AtpAgent()` from our SDK if you are using password auth. This guide will use password auth.

If you are using password auth, you should generate an [app password](/specs/xrpc#app-passwords) for your account rather than using your main account password. If you are using Bluesky as an auth provider, you can generate an app password in your [account settings](https://bsky.app/settings/app-passwords).

Start by importing `AtpAgent`, creating an `agent` object, and providing credentials to `agent.login()`:

```tsx
import { AtpAgent } from '@atproto/api'

const agent = new AtpAgent({
    service: 'https://bsky.social'
})
await agent.login({
    identifier: 'alex.bsky.team',
    password: 'your-app-password'
})
```

In general, applications designed for multiple users should use [OAuth](/guides/auth) authentication rather than app password sessions. Password auth is acceptable for bots and command line tools.

Once you have a logged-in `agent`, you can create a `Client` instance to read and write data:

```tsx
import { Client } from '@atproto/lex'
const client = new Client(agent)
```

Now you are ready to start [making requests](/guides/reading-data)!
