## Password Auth

The first step when working with AT data is authenticating. You can authenticate using any [OAuth](/guides/auth) provider, or with `AtpAgent()` from our SDK if you are using password auth. This guide will use password auth.

## Typescript

Begin by installing the ATProto SDK packages:

```bash
npm install @atproto/lex @atproto/api
```

Because AT uses regular HTTP verbs and HTTP endpoints, you can also follow this guide by using a CLI tool like cURL to make HTTP requests following the [HTTP Reference](https://docs.bsky.app/docs/category/http-reference) endpoints. Most users will want to use an SDK.

## Creating a Client

If you are using password auth, you should generate an [app password](/specs/xrpc#app-passwords) for your account rather than using your main account password. If you are using Bluesky as an auth provider, you can generate an app password in your [account settings](https://bsky.app/settings/app-passwords).

Start by importing `AtpAgent`, creating an `agent` object, and providing credentials to `agent.login()`:

```tsx
import { AtpAgent } from '@atproto/api'

const agent = new AtpAgent({
    service: 'https://bsky.social'
})
await agent.login({
    identifier: 'alex.bsky.team',
    password: 'your-app-password'
})
```

In general, applications designed for multiple users should use [OAuth](/guides/auth) authentication rather than app password sessions. Password auth is acceptable for bots and command line tools.

Once you have a logged-in `agent`, you can create a `Client` instance to read and write data:

```tsx
import { Client } from '@atproto/lex'
const client = new Client(agent)
```

Now you are ready to start [making requests](/guides/reading-data)!
