# Hello World

Get up and running with AT Protocol in just a few lines of code. This example fetches a public profile from the network — no authentication required!

## Install the SDK

```bash
npm install @atproto/api
```

## Fetch a Profile

Create a file called `hello.mjs`:

```javascript
import { AtpAgent } from '@atproto/api'

const agent = new AtpAgent({ service: 'https://public.api.bsky.app' })

const profile = await agent.getProfile({ actor: 'bsky.app' })

console.log(`Name: ${profile.data.displayName}`)
console.log(`Handle: ${profile.data.handle}`)
console.log(`Bio: ${profile.data.description}`)
```

Run it:

```bash
node hello.mjs
```

You should see output like:

```
Name: Bluesky
Handle: bsky.app
Bio: official Bluesky account (check username👆)

Bugs, feature requests, feedback: support@bsky.app
```

That's it! You've just made your first AT Protocol API call.

## What's Happening

The `AtpAgent` connects to the public Bluesky API. The `getProfile` method fetches a user's profile by their handle or DID. Since this is a public read, no authentication is needed.

## Next Steps

Now that you've got the basics working:

- **[Read more data](/guides/reading-data)** — Fetch posts, likes, and follows from user repositories
- **[Authenticate users](/guides/auth)** — Set up OAuth or app password authentication
- **[Write data](/guides/writing-data)** — Create posts and records in authenticated sessions
- **[Build an app](/guides/applications)** — Follow the full tutorial to build a complete application
