## Bots

Bots are accounts on the network that post automatically. Popular ones include bots that post the magnitude of recent earthquakes, photos from an archive on a regular schedule, etc.

There is a Bot example in our [Cookbook](https://github.com/bluesky-social/cookbook/tree/main/ts-bot) that can be used as a reference.
