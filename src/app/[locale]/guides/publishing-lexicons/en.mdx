# Publishing Lexicons

Lexicons are designed to be machine-readable and network-accessible. While it is not currently *required* that a lexicon is available on the network, it is strongly advised to publish lexicon so that a single canonical & authoritative representation is available to consumers of the method.

You can use [`goat`](https://github.com/bluesky-social/goat), our command line tool, for creating and publishing Lexicons. The Lexicon-related features are available under [`goat lex`](https://github.com/bluesky-social/goat?tab=readme-ov-file#lexicon-development) :

- publishing schemas to and synchronizing from the AT network
- diffing, linting, and verifying schema evolution rules

For example: in a project directory, you can download some existing Lexicons, which will get saved as JSON files in `./lexicons/`:

```markdown
$ goat lex pull com.atproto.repo.strongRef com.atproto.moderation. app.bsky.actor.profile
 🟢 com.atproto.repo.strongRef
 🟢 com.atproto.moderation.defs
 🟢 com.atproto.moderation.createReport
 🟢 app.bsky.actor.profile
```

You can also create a new Lexicon record with `goat lex new record`:

```markdown
$ goat lex new record dev.project.thing

$ open ./lexicons/dev/project/thing.json
```

And eventually publish it with `goat lex publish`:

```markdown
$ goat lex publish
 🟢 dev.project.thing
```

Refer to the [Lexicon Style Guide](/guides/lexicon-style-guide) for guidance on creating new Lexicons.
