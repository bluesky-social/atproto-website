## Listing Records

You can read posts from a user's data repository with `client.list()`:

```tsx
const posts = await client.list(app.bsky.feed.post, {
  limit: 10,
  repo: 'alex.bsky.team',
})
```

Each Lexicon will have its own parameters; for `app.bsky.feed.post`, you can specify the `repo` (a user's handle or [DID](#did-resolution)) and a `limit` on the number of posts to return. Refer to [`app.bsky.feed.post`](https://docs.bsky.app/docs/api/app-bsky-feed-get-posts) for this complete Lexicon.

## Getting Records

You can use `client.get()` to read an individual record by its [`rkey`](/specs/record-key):

```tsx
const post = await client.get(app.bsky.feed.post, {
  rkey: '3jxf7z2k3q2',
})
```

## DID Resolution

In AT, user data is resolved through [DIDs](/guides/sync#data-repositories), also known as [Decentralized Identifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_identifier). Most AT Protocol applications use [`did:plc` DIDs](/guides/the-at-stack#did-plc) when registering user accounts.

You can resolve a known username to a DID using the `com.atproto.identity.resolveHandle` endpoint. This means that you can just visit this address in a browser with a `handle=` arugment to look up your DID:

```
https://bsky.social/xrpc/com.atproto.identity.resolveHandle?handle=youraccount.bsky.social
```

```
{
did: "did:plc:3vekukmab2djjeengw2o3wln"
}
```

The Typescript SDK also provides the DID of the currently-authenticated as `client.did`:

```tsx
const your_did = client.did
```

## Unauthenticated Reads

Some API endpoints can be accessed without authentication. You can create an unauthenticated client by passing a public API URL to a new `Client()`:

```tsx
import { Client } from '@atproto/lex'
import * as app from './lexicons/app.js'

const client = new Client('https://public.api.bsky.app')
```

As with an authenticated client, you can `.get()` any public records, like a user's profile:

```tsx
const profile = await client.get(app.bsky.actor.profile)
```

You can make API calls to any Lexicon using the same SDK client pattern. For more examples, refer to [the SDK documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@atproto/lex).

Next, you might try [writing](/guides/writing-data) to a user's data repository.
