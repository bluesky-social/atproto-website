## What are these services?

The Atmosphere uses two main services: the PDS and the Application.

**The PDS** is a somewhat "dumb" service. It hosts the users' keys and data, but it doesn't run applications. You could almost think of it like a filesystem.

**The Application** connects users. It reads from and writes to the PDS, and turns all that data into a meaningful experience.

## Which should I run?

If you're looking to make sure your identity and data stay in your hands, you should run a PDS.

If you're looking to ensure you can connect to users, or if you want to run moderation differently, then you should run an application.

## What about moderation?

Most moderation occurs in the applications. Typically, this is done by publishing "labels," and some applications support user-operated labelers.

## What about the other services?

The "Relay" is a helper service that aggregates user activity from the network of PDSes. People frequently reuse existing relays, but you can deploy one yourself.

Ozone and Osprey are both moderation tools. They primarily publish labels to be used by applications.
