Bluesky is an open social network built on the AT Protocol, a flexible technology that will never lock developers out of the ecosystems that they help build. With atproto, third-party can be as seamless as first-party through custom feeds, federated services, clients, and more.

**If you're a developer interested in building on atproto, we'd love to email you an invite code.** Simply share your GitHub (or similar) profile with us via [this form](https://forms.gle/gHe4cyBrGCGRzqZt7).

Read more about the AT Protocol [here](https://atproto.com/) and check out some third-party developer projects [here](/showcase).
