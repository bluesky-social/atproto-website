# Welcome to the New atproto.com

You might have noticed the official AT Protocol website has been completely redesigned. This isn’t just a refreshed stylesheet — we’ve added new tutorials, SDK documentation (featuring our redesigned SDKs and new tooling), a new interactive homepage, internationalization, and moved the blog you are reading right now to a proper home. The goal, as always: to make it easier than ever for developers to just build things on AT Protocol.

## New homepage

The homepage now shows you what is actually happening on the network, live and in real time. A live firehose viewer streams actual activity from the AT Protocol network in real time — posts, likes, follows — all flowing past as they happen. Alongside that, we step through the core concepts of the protocol: it’s just JSON, it’s strongly typed, it’s hyperlinked, and those links are content-addressed.

From the homepage, you can jump straight to building. Create a new social app, write a bot, build a custom feed with algorithms you decide, and manage your own identity.

## New design and navigation

The site has a refreshed visual design with proper dark mode support and better responsive layouts for every screen size. Our site nav and IA has been completely rewritten into top-level categories: Auth, Reads and Writes, Sync, Lexicons, Media, and Moderation — with an accessible side nav that makes it easy to find what you’re looking for and understand where you are in the docs.

## New documentation

This is the biggest part of the diff. New tutorials, guides, and docs to make it easier for anyone to get building. There are now four end-to-end tutorials:

- **Build an Agent** — build an automated agent that posts to Bluesky
- **Custom feed** — create and publish a feed based on algorithms *you* control
- **OAuth** — it all starts with identity, here’s how to build a web app with OAuth
- **Statusphere refresh** — we rebuilt the long-standing Statusphere app using our new lex SDX showcasing a full social app with custom Lexicons, real-time sync, and a custom UI

Beyond tutorials, there are more than two dozen new topical guides covering every aspect of the AT Protocol, providing a clear baseline for total beginners and experienced devs alike. Wherever possible, code samples are available in both TypeScript and Go with embedded samples inline.

The new docs cover the new SDK workflow using atproto/lex. Install Lexicons with `lex install`, generate types with `lex build`, and import them directly into your project in a way that’s type-safe for modern dev workflows. We also now feature our newest tooling, \`tap\` and \`goat\`, as the best solutions for getting work done, and we recommend several community projects like [Microcosm](https://www.microcosm.blue/) as well.

## New blog

We moved the blog posts about AT Protocol from the Bluesky docs site over here and we’ll be publishing more posts, more frequently. Add the RSS feed to stay up-to-date on the latest news.

We’re also publishing new posts into the Atmosphere as [standard.site](https://standard.site) Lexicons to make it possible to discover and share on protocol.

## Internationalization

Virtually all of the site has been translated into Japanese thanks to incredible contributions from community member [yamarten](https://bsky.app/profile/yamarten.bsky.social). We’ve also included machine-translated Korean and Portuguese coverage across top-level guides and tutorials, with more to come.

## We can just build things

Explore the tutorials. Try the new SDKs. The [entire site is open source](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto-website) and contributions, corrections, and translations are all welcome.

The ethos of the AT Protocol is we can just build things and the new site aims to make that easier than ever.
