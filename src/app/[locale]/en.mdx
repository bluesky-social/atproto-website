## A Web of Data {{className: 'text-2xl mt-2 scroll-mt-32'}}

The Atmosphere is a web of interconnected data. It is the porous membrane through which posts, profiles, and comments flow.  It is a network of databases working in conjunction to provide one global database - a tool for people to communicate with each other through data.

The purpose of the Atmosphere is to run social applications at scale. It's designed for real-world applications with hundreds of millions of users. The Bluesky app has 6mm registered users and 500k DAU, and runs at roughly the same cost-efficiency as traditional applications.

The vision and mission of the Atmosphere is to make it easy for people to build. Whether you're a weekend hacker or building a startup, you should have access to a social network to build upon. The joy of social programming should be available to everyone.
