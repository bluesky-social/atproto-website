# Protocol Overview

The **Authenticated Transfer Protocol**, aka **ATP**, is a protocol for large-scale distributed social applications. This document will introduce you to the ideas behind the AT Protocol.

## Identity

Participants are identified by domain names in AT Protocol. These domains map to cryptographic URLs which secure the participant's account and its data.

## Data repositories

Participant data is exchanged in [signed data repositories](/guides/data-repos). These repositories are collections of records which include posts, comments, likes, follows, media blobs, etc.

## Federation

ATP syncs the repositories in a federated networking model. Federation was chosen to ensure the network is convenient to use and reliably available. Commands are sent between servers using [HTTPS + XRPC](/specs/xrpc).

## Interoperation

A global schemas network called [Lexicon](/specs/lexicon) is used to unify the names and behaviors of the calls across the servers. Servers implement "lexicons" to support featuresets, including the core [ATP Lexicon](/lexicons/atproto-com) for syncing participant repositories and the [Bsky Lexicon](/lexicons/bsky-app) to provide basic social behaviors.

While the Web exchanges documents, the AT Protocol exchanges schematic and semantic information, enabling the software from different orgs to understand each others' data. This gives ATP clients freedom to produce user interfaces independently of the servers, and removes the need to exchange rendering code (HTML/JS/CSS) while browsing content.

## Achieving scale

ATP distinguishes between "small-world" vs "big-world" networking. *Small-world* networking encompass inter-personal activity while *big-world* networking aggregates activity outside of the user's personal interactions. 

* **Small-world**: delivery of events targeted at specific participants such as mentions, replies, and DMs, and sync of datasets according to follow graphs.
* **Big-world**: large-scale metrics (likes, reposts, followers), content discovery (algorithms), and participant search.

Personal Data Servers (PDS) are responsible for small-world networking while indexing services separately crawl the network to provide big-world networking.

The small-world/big-world distinction is intended to achieve scale as well as a high degree of customization.

## Algorithmic choice

As with Web search engines, participants are free to select their indexers. Each feed, discovery section, or search interface is integrated into the PDS while being served from a third party service.

## Account portability

We assume that a Personal Data Server may fail at any time, either by going offline in its entirety or by ceasing service for specific participants. ATP's goal is to ensure that a participant can migrate their account to a new PDS without the server's involvement.

Participant data is stored in [signed data repositories](/guides/data-repos) and verified by [DIDs](/guides/identity). DIDs are essentially registries of participant certificates, similar in some ways to the TLS certificate system. They are expected to be secure, reliable, and independent of the participants' PDS.

![DID Documents](/img/did-doc.jpg)

Each DID Document publishes two public keys: a signing key and a recovery key.

* **Signing key**: Asserts changes to the DID Document *and* to the participant's data repository.
* **Recovery key**: Asserts changes to the DID Document; may override the signing key within a 72-hour window.

The signing key is entrusted to the PDS so that it can manage the participant's data, but the recovery key is saved by the participant, e.g. as a paper key. This makes it possible for the participant to update their account to a new PDS without the original host's help.

A backup of the participant’s data is persistently synced to their client as a backup (contingent on the disk space available). Should a PDS disappear without notice, the participant should be able to migrate to a new provider by updating their DID Document and uploading the backup.

## Speech, reach, and moderation

ATP's model is that _speech_ and _reach_ should be two separate layers, built to work with each other. The “speech” layer should remain neutral, distributing authority and designed to ensure everyone has a voice. The “reach” layer lives on top, built for flexibility and designed to scale.

![Speech vs Reach](/img/speech-vs-reach.jpg)

The base layer of ATP (Personal Data Repositories and Federated Networking) creates a common space for speech where everyone is free to participate, analogous to the Web where anyone can put up a website. The Indexing services then enable reach by aggregating content from the network, analogous to a search engine.

## Specifications

Five primary specs comprise the v1 of the @-protocol. These specs are:

- [Authenticated Transfer Protocol](/specs/atp)
- [Cross-system RPC (XRPC)](/specs/xrpc)
- [Lexicon Schemas](/specs/lexicon)
- [NameSpaced IDs (NSIDs)](/specs/nsid)
- [DID:Placeholder (did:plc)](/specs/did-plc)

These specs can be organize into three layers of dependency:
